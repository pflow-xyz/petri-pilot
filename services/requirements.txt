# Example Requirements for Petri Pilot

## Order Processing Workflow

Create a Petri net model for an e-commerce order processing system:

1. Orders are received and queued for processing
2. Each order must be validated before payment
3. Invalid orders are rejected and moved to a rejection queue
4. Valid orders proceed to payment processing
5. After payment, orders are shipped
6. Shipped orders are marked as complete

Requirements:
- Only one order can be processed at a time (mutual exclusion)
- An order cannot be both validated and rejected
- Total tokens must be conserved (no orders lost)

## User Registration Flow

Create a Petri net for user registration:

1. User submits registration form
2. Email is verified (async)
3. Account is activated after email verification
4. User can optionally set up 2FA
5. Registration is complete

Constraints:
- User cannot activate without email verification
- 2FA setup is optional but must happen before completion
