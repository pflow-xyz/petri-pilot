// supplier: `make` needs a job and ten units of stock, and `deliver` brings
// fifty units at a time.
//
// The point of the fixture is the state Depletion cannot see. With deliveries
// worth less than the machine can consume, the stock is refilled and drawn down
// all run — never empty for long, its mean well above the ten units a firing
// takes — and yet it is what the run is waiting for. That was the
// shipped café's milk exactly: 990 units an hour of demand against 1000 of
// supply, an empty Depleted list, and an operator told their idle baristas were
// losing half the trade with no way to reach "buy more milk" from the output.
//
// jobs is stocked far beyond what the horizon can consume and its arc is
// non-kinetic, so the machine's pace is its own rate and the only thing that
// can hold it up is stock.
