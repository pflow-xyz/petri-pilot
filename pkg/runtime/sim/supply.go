// SupplyKind says whether a place is something an operator could buy more of.
//
// Waiting on a place means opposite things depending on the answer, and a
// contention report that does not distinguish them is inverted for half its
// entries. "start_cappuccino spent 90% of the day with no cappuccino order
// waiting" is not a bottleneck — it is a quiet shop, and the fix is customers,
// not equipment. "start_cappuccino spent 26% of the day with no free barista"
// is a bottleneck, and the fix is a barista. The café measured exactly that:
// the four highest contentions were empty order queues and the staff pool it
// was actually limited by sat sixth, so anything ranking by raw fraction
// reported the shop's idleness as its constraint.
//
// The discriminator is whether the place's supply is bounded *independently of
// demand*, which is what "you could buy more of it" means structurally. A queue
// is fed by the net's own flow and has no ceiling of its own, so it is short
// only when upstream is slow — a symptom, never a cause.

	// consumes red to produce green with no other input. Waiting on one is not a
	// capacity finding, because there is nothing to buy: "the light spent 28% of
	// the day not being red" is a description of the cycle, not a shortage.

// ClassifySupply labels every token place in the model.
//
// Conservation is decided by go-pflow's Farkas P-invariant basis rather than by
// naming convention, which is the whole point: the café console used to tell a
// resource from a queue with `!place.startsWith(ownSubnetPrefix)`, a rule that
// happened to work for one composed bundle and answers "queue" for every place
// in a single-net model. A caller must not have to know how the places were
// named to tell a bottleneck from an idle shop.
//
// Sitting in an invariant is necessary but not sufficient, and the café is why.
// The staff pool satisfies two conservation laws — `available + busy` and
// `available + sum(brewing_X)` — so membership alone makes every
// work-in-progress place a "resource", and the run then reports 58% of the day
// with no espresso brewing as a harder constraint than 29% with no free
// barista. It is the same pool seen from the other side: brewing_espresso is
// empty when the baristas are idle or making something else, which is a
// statement about demand and mix.
//
// The second half of the rule separates them. A conserved total is fixed by the
// initial marking, so the only way to have more is to *start* with more — and a
// conserved place that starts empty therefore has no stock of its own at all.
// Whatever it holds, the net put there. That is a queue in every sense that
// matters here, and it is exactly what brewing_X and staff/busy are. (A pool
// modelled as starting fully committed would be misread; that model has no
// place to write the headcount in, which is its own problem.)
//
// A truncated basis (a net too large for the row limit) can only lose
// invariants, so an unclassifiable place falls back to SupplyQueue — the kind
// that ranks lowest and claims least.
//
// The fallback is also where a stock buffer with nothing declared about it
// lands, and that is not a gap the analysis can close. A shelf refilled by a
// delivery and an order queue filled by arriving customers are the same net:
// both are fed by a transition with no inputs and drained by the work. What
// separates them is that the shelf has a size, so declaring a Capacity is how a
// model says "this is a thing I buy" — and a model that declares neither a
// capacity nor a conservation law has not said it anywhere.
