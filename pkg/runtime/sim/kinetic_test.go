// work starts but does not make the work go faster.

// The tool is handed back by the same firing that took it, so its count is a
// constant of the run and any change in throughput has to come from the rate
// law rather than from the tool running out. Under mass action over every input
// — which is what this engine did before the kinetics flag — eight tools would
// make the shop eight times as fast, which is the defect this fixture exists to
