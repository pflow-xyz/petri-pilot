// Package sim runs a model forward in time without changing it.
//
// Generated applications embed their model, so they can answer questions about
// what happens next — "when do I run out of beans", "how long is the queue at
// this arrival rate" — from the marking they are already holding.
//
// Everything here is a **pure projection**. A simulation takes a marking and
// returns a trajectory; it never fires a transition on an aggregate, never
// appends an event, and never touches a store. That distinction is the whole
// point of the package. The coffee-shop dashboard predates it and does the
// opposite: it drives its simulation by POSTing real transitions
// (dashboard.js executeTransition), so every simulated tick writes a real event,
// 409s are swallowed as "expected", and the app needs a reset button to
// undo having been asked a hypothetical question. A forecast should not be able
// to corrupt the thing it forecasts.
//
// Two engines, because they answer different questions:
//
//   - Forecast is the continuous one: mass-action ODE over a real-valued
//     marking, solved with Tsit5. Smooth, deterministic, fast. Right when token
//     counts are large enough that the average is the answer — 1000 coffee
//     beans drawn down 20 at a time.
//   - Simulate is the discrete one: Gillespie's SSA over integer counts, where
//     firings are random events and the result has real variance. Right when
//     counts are small enough that noise decides the outcome — three baristas,
//     a queue of four.
//
// Asking for the mean of an SSA run and asking the ODE are not the same
// question, and for a queue they can disagree sharply.
