# gqlgen configuration for erc20-token
#
# This configuration is provided for reference if you want to use
# full gqlgen code generation. The default petri-pilot GraphQL
# implementation uses a lightweight built-in handler.
#
# To use gqlgen instead:
# 1. Install gqlgen: go install github.com/99designs/gqlgen@latest
# 2. Run: go generate ./...
# 3. Replace GraphQLHandler in graphql.go with gqlgen's handler
